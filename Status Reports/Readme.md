# Status Reports Folder
Weekly status reports go into this folder

This Readme.md serves as the front page of this folder - update the table with very succinct weekly reports.

Project Plan.md is a document that should be updated accordingly as the project develops through the year.

Status Report Fall Week XX.md is a template for to copy-paste into new Status reports you generate every week.

## Fall Semester

| Document | Tasks | Accomplishments | Issues |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 1 Status Report | Initation of communication between team members and advisors, schedule initial meetings  | We, as student team members, attended our first meeting. We worked on our team contract and got to know one another. | No problems to report! |
| Week 2 Status Report |Established point of contact for VCU building maintenance management.|Brainstormed objectives and deliverables for project based on Siemensâ€™ requirements and parameters |Raised potential use of preexisting predictive maintenance models developed by Siemens (need to contact Siemens for access)|
| Week 3 Status Report | Continue communication with Byron for Navigator API and backend data storage of the platform Write proposal and develop implementation ideas further | Presented types of mechanical faults in building systems, Presented findings from past research in machine learning implementations of predictive maintenance, Discussed possible implementations of the ML/Deep Learning models and the architecture for them | None to report! |
| Week 4 Status Report |Write proposal and develop implementation ideas further, Settle on domain for data modeling, in terms of room/lab and VCU building, Continue communication with the maintenance team for VCU Buildings, Send agenda and write slides for next meeting share day before |Presented findings from past research in machine learning implementations of predictive maintenance, Discussed re-iteration of project goals, a section to be included in the project proposal, specifically how to make goals more specific and actionable |None to report! |
